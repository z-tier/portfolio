      <h2>Hi, hello.</h2>
      <p>I’m an 18-year-old game developer and game designer who goes by the name of <strong>ztier</strong>.
        Since the start of 2025, I’ve developed two small-scope games for game jams using the <strong>Godot</strong>
        game engine (which I promise is more fun than it sounds).</p>
      <p>In terms of coding, I'm pretty comfortable with <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> (as proven by
        this very page), <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Lua</strong>, and of course, <strong>GDScript</strong>,
        Godot's very own scripting language.</p>
      <p>I’m still a “newbie” in the game development world, having just started this year, but I’m eager to learn and
        improve every day. If you’ve got feedback or even an insult, hit me with it — I'll just take it as free
        advice.</p>

      <h2>My Games</h2>
      <p>Curious about my games? Well, you can check them out on
        <a href="https://z-tier.itch.io/" target="_blank">itch.io</a>. They're not the best, but they're not the worst
        either.

      <h2>Creative Writing</h2>
      <p>When I’m not busy making games crash, I dabble in the world of creative writing. I’ve written two (incomplete,
        but still amazing) stories that you can check out:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.webnovel.com/book/developer-journal_31810901308764005" target="_blank">Developer
            Journal</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.scribblehub.com/series/1421586/the-man-of-many-faces/" target="_blank">The Man of Many
            Faces</a></li>
